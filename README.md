## Description:
A Full-Stack mobile-first progressive web application that allows users to track their budgets by adding expenses and income. The application also allows users to see a visual representation of their budget via a graph. They are able to add a transaction with or without connection. Transactions are stored in the indexedDB and transferred to the server. The server then stores the transactions in a MongoDB database when the user returns online. Utilizes IndexedDB(for offline support) MongoDB, Express, Service Workers, and Node.js.
